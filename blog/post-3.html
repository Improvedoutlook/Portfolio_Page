                    <h2>Starting from Scratch</h2>
                    <p>About 11 months ago, I was working in retail but had a strong desire to break into tech, specifically as a full-stack developer. With no prior experience, I began learning to code in my spare time after work.</p>

                    <h2>Learning in My Spare Time</h2>
                    <p>For the first 9 months, I dedicated an hour or more after work, several days a week, to building my skills. I focused on FreeCodeCamp and other online resources, working through Responsive Web Design, JavaScript, and building small practice projects. Consistency was key; even if I couldn’t code every day, I made sure to steadily build up my knowledge.</p>

                    <h2>Building Practice Projects</h2>
                    <p>I applied what I learned by working on small, manageable projects. One of the most helpful was building a ToDo List app, which helped me solidify my understanding of front-end basics and become comfortable with problem-solving and debugging. After a few months of coding, my wife’s uncle—who is a senior software engineer—let me do some pro-bono work on his company’s quality management system. Although it wasn’t a company codebase, it was something he’d built himself. I fixed a few bugs and added small features. These little steps proved that my time spent learning wasn’t in vain. Even if they were small wins, it was a start.</p>

                    <h2>Shifting to SQL and Backend Development</h2>
                    <p>As I moved closer to getting my first developer role, I pivoted to focus on SQL and backend development, knowing my new job would heavily involve working with databases, specifically using SQL Server Management Studio. Learning T-SQL helped me bridge the gap between front-end work and full-stack development.</p>

                    <h2>Getting My First Developer Job</h2>
                    <p>After 9 months of self-learning, I landed my first developer role two months ago. I’m now working with technologies like C#, .NET Core, and SQL, and I continue to expand my knowledge every day. The learning curve has been steep, but the transition from self-learning to working professionally has accelerated my growth in ways I hadn’t imagined.</p>

                    <h2>Key Lessons I’ve Learned Along the Way</h2>
                    <p>Consistency is Key: You don’t need to learn everything at once. Start small, stay consistent, and the knowledge will accumulate over time.</p>
                    <p>Projects > Theory: Applying what you’ve learned in real-world projects is much more valuable than just studying theory. Build something, even if it’s simple.</p>
                    <p>Learning Never Stops: Even after getting a job, I’m constantly learning new things. It’s humbling but also exciting. Get comfortable with feeling uncomfortable because the more you wrestle with problems and find solutions, the more you enjoy the process rather than focusing on the destination.</p>
                    <p>Don’t Be Afraid to Ask for Help: Whether it’s from the developer community or coworkers, reaching out when you’re stuck is critical for growth.</p>
                    <p>Think Lazy: I’m a fan of Occam’s Razor, which suggests that the simplest solution is often the best. This applies to programming too. Don’t overcomplicate things, especially when you’re still learning.</p>

                    <h2>Advice for Aspiring Developers</h2>
                    <p>Start Now: Whether you can dedicate an hour or 10 minutes a day, just start learning. You’ll be surprised how much progress you can make over time.</p>
                    <p>Be Patient with Yourself: The learning process has ups and downs, and the curve is steep. Even developers with decades of experience still face challenges. Struggling is part of the process, like building muscle. Each challenge you overcome brings you closer to your goal.</p>
                    <p>Seek Out a Support System: Whether it’s through online communities, mentors, or friends learning to code alongside you, having a support system can make a big difference.</p>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Your coding journey is just that—yours. Don’t compare your progress to others. Everyone learns at their own pace, and there’s no single path to success. If you can find joy in the process and stick with it, there’s no reason you won’t succeed. Stay consistent, embrace the challenges, and trust in your ability to grow.</p>
