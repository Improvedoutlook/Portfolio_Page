                    <h2>How to AI When You're a newer Dev</h2>
                    <p>We've heard about AI at nauseam at this point. But a question we're all probably asking is: Where do I fit into this paradigm?</p>

                    <h2>The Rub</h2>
                    <p>AI has been around for decades. If you've played against a computer on any game, used any modern email application, or had any sort of automation in your life, AI was probably working behind the scenes.</p>
                    <p>What most people are talking about nowadays when they use the term is "generative AI". That is the ability for AI to generate text, photos, videos and so on. Since the rollout of ChatGPT a few years ago and the countless number of LLMs (and now agents) that have followed, we have more selection than we can reasonably keep up with. Added to the selection fatigue, anyone writing real software in a production environment can tell you that AI is augmenting the way software is being written today.</p>
                    <p>Along with that is a waterfall of hype, fearmongering and straight up lies about what this (sort of) new technology means for everyone. With respect to whoever is reading this, the "everyone" I'm talking about is software engineers. Yes, this includes the other adjacent terms for what I believe is basically the same thing: programmers, developers, etc. Of course there are many engineers with much experience writing software that have a broad spectrum of feelings and opinions on the subject. You don't have to look far online to hear them. Let me be clear: though I totally empathize with someone who has grown accustomed to writing software a certain way, spent thousands of hours manually writing code, figuring out why deployment builds were breaking, and debugging legacy decisions, they are not the focus of this discussion.</p>
                    <p>The fact is, despite how challenging this time is for senior engineers, I believe the people who are or will be the most affected by this change are newer developers: the ones who are just starting out, the ones who are trying to break into the industry, the ones who have less than 5 years experience.</p>
                    <p>Why do I say that? Because senior engineers generally have a wealth of experience and knowledge to fall back on. They have seen the evolution of software development over decades. They have a deep understanding of core concepts, architectures and best practices that AI simply cannot replicate.</p>
                    <p>Newer developers, on the other hand, are still building their foundational knowledge. They may not yet have the experience to critically evaluate AI-generated code or to understand the nuances of software design that go beyond mere syntax and structure. They may not have developed the ability to "sniff test" what AI is presenting confidently as a solution. For them the game has changed perhaps before they even learned the rules. That's hard, <strong>really</strong> hard.</p>

                    <p>So what is the less-experienced to do about this change...a globally massive change in an industry that has always been acquainted with it? I'll list some things that have helped me as a newer developer working professionally for about a year and a half.</p>
